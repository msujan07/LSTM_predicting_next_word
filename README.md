# Predicting the next word in a sentence using LSTM
The LSTM project is a tool that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the next word in a sentence.

<h2>What is LSTM?</h2>

<h3>Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are an extension of RNN that extend the memory. LSTM are used as the building blocks for the layers of a RNN. LSTMs assign data “weights” which helps RNNs to either let new information in, forget information or give it importance enough to impact the output.</h3>


⭐ Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are an extension of RNN that extend the memory. LSTM are used as the building blocks for the layers of a RNN. LSTMs assign       data “weights” which helps RNNs to either let new information in, forget information or give it importance enough to impact the output.

⭐ LSTMs enable RNNs to remember inputs over a long period of time. This is because LSTMs contain information in a memory, much like the memory of a computer. The LSTM     can read, write and delete information from its memory.

⭐ This memory can be seen as a gated cell, with gated meaning the cell decides whether or not to store or delete information (i.e., if it opens the gates or not),         based on the importance it assigns to the information. The assigning of importance happens through weights, which are also learned by the algorithm. This simply       means that it learns over time what information is important and what is not.
